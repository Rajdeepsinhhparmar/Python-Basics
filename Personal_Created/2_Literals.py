### NOTES ###

# 1. Literals are notations for representing some fixed values in code. Python has various types of literals - for example
# a literal can be a number (numeric literals, e.g., 123), or a string (string literals, e.g., "I am a literal.").

# 2. The binary system is a system of numbers that employs 2 as the base. Therefore, a binary number is made up of 0s and 1s only,
# e.g., 1010 is 10 in decimal.

# Octal and hexadecimal numeration systems, similarly, employ 8 and 16 as their bases respectively.
# The hexadecimal system uses the decimal numbers and six extra letters.

# 3. Integers (or simply ints) are one of the numerical types supported by Python.
# They are numbers written without a fractional component, e.g., 256, or -1 (negative integers).

# 4. Floating-point numbers (or simply floats) are another one of the numerical types supported by Python.
# They are numbers that contain (or are able to contain) a fractional component, e.g., 1.27.

# 5. To encode an apostrophe or a quote inside a string you can either use the escape character,
# e.g., 'I\'m happy.', or open and close the string using an opposite set of symbols to the ones you wish to encode,
# e.g., "I'm happy." to encode an apostrophe, and 'He said "Python", not "typhoon"' to encode a (double) quote.

# 6. Boolean values are the two constant objects True and False used to represent
# truth values (in numeric contexts 1 is True, while 0 is False.

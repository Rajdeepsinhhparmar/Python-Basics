### Notes ###

# 1. The print() function is a built-in function. It prints/outputs a specified message to the screen/consol window.

# 2. Built-in functions, contrary to user-defined functions, are always available and don't have to be imported.
# Python 3.8 comes with 69 built-in functions. You can find their full list provided in alphabetical order in the Python Standard Library.

# 3. To call a function (this process is known as function invocation or function call),
# you need to use the function name followed by parentheses. You can pass arguments into a function by placing them inside the parentheses.
#You must separate arguments with a comma, e.g., print("Hello,", "world!"). An "empty" print() function outputs an empty line to the screen.

# 4. Python strings are delimited with quotes, e.g., "I am a string" (double quotes), or 'I am a string, too' (single quotes).

# 5. Computer programs are collections of instructions. An instruction is a command to perform a specific task when executed,
#e.g., to print a certain message to the screen.

# 6. In Python strings the backslash (\) is a special character which announces that the next character has a different meaning,
# e.g., \n (the newline character) starts a new output line.

# 7. Positional arguments are the ones whose meaning is dictated by their position, e.g., the second argument is outputted after the first,
# the third is outputted after the second, etc.

# 8. Keyword arguments are the ones whose meaning is not dictated by their location, but by a special word (keyword) used to identify them.

# 9. The end and sep parameters can be used for formatting the output of the print() function. The sep parameter
# specifies the separator between the outputted arguments (e.g., print("H", "E", "L", "L", "O", sep="-"),
# whereas the end parameter specifies what to print at the end of the print statement.
